# DungeonCrawler
A 3D Classic dungeon crawler game written in GameMaker 1.4
Currently not got a proper name and is open since it's just a personal project for now.

The current version can be downloaded here: https://github.com/KiranEmery/DungeonCrawler/blob/main/exes/DungeonCrawler%20PreAlpha%201.exe

Current features:
* Random map generation (Press R to generate a new floor)
* Can walk and move around
* Stairways are spawned (they look like doors), currently they don't do anything
* Press [TAB] to free the mouse or re-lock it to the window

I have no idea how far this will progress or how often I will work on it.
