Current features:
* Random map generation (Press R to generate a new floor)
* Can walk and move around
* Stairways are spawned (they look like doors), currently they don't do anything
* Press [TAB] to free the mouse or re-lock it to the window - buggy as the game continues and react to input if mouse is unlocked
